self-signed certificate: when we dont have a domain name and that stuff we use self-signed certificate

openssl-standards: when we want to use a official website we should use CA certificate to secure it also in the server.



"sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout 	/etc/ssl/private/nginx-selfsigned.key -out /etc/ssl/certs/nginx-selfsigned.crt"

openssl req: to install the certificate with the following requirments.

-x509: thats mean that we want to create a self-signed certificate.

-nodes: this option it will skip our server to ask foe passphrase. because we dont want to stop at the middle than add it.

-days 365: to be valide for 365 day.

-newkey rs1:2048 : this specify that we want to create the certificate and the key that required to sign the certificate
and the (rsa:2048) that says create RSA key 2048 bit long.

-keyout: tells openSSl that the private key u will be created outside.

-out: that tells OPenSSl where to place the certificate.
